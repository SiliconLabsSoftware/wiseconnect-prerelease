 * @brief
 *   Allows the Network Processor (NWP) to write content to the common flash from M4.
 *
 * @details
 *   This function enables the NWP to write data to the common flash memory from
 *   the M4 core. It is a blocking API.
 *
 * @param[in] write_address
 *   The address in the common flash memory where the write operation should begin.
 *   - For the M4 region, the write address should start from 0x8000000. Possible
 *     values range from the M4 image end address to the M4 region end address.
 *   - For the NWP region, the write address should range from 0 to (20K-1).
 *   - For sector erase, it should be multiples of 4K.
 *
 * @param[in] write_data
 *   Pointer to the data to be written.
 *
 * @param[in] write_data_length
 *   The total length of the data, which should be multiples of 4K for sector erase.
 *
 * @param[in] flash_sector_erase_enable
 *   Enable or disable sector erase.
 *   - 1: Erases multiples of 4 KB of data.
 *   - 0: Disable, allows writing data onto flash.
 *
 * @return
 *   sl_status_t. See [Status Codes](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/platform-common/status)
 *   and [WiSeConnect Status Codes](../wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-err-codes/wiseconnect-status-codes)
 *   for details.
