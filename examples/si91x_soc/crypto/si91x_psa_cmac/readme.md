## Purpose/Scope

- This example uses the PSA Crypto API to perform Message Authentication Code (CMAC) operations on the supported device.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

To use this application following Hardware, Software and the Project Setup is required

### Hardware Requirements

  - Windows PC
  - Silicon Labs SiWx91x Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements
  - Simplicity SDK version: 2024.6.2
  - SiWx91x SDK
  - Embedded Development Environment
    - For Silicon Labs SiWx91x, use the latest version of Simplicity Studio (refer **"Download and Install Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html**)

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

- **Silicon Labs SiWx91x** refer **"Download SDKs"**, **"Add SDK to Simplicity Studio"**, **"Connect SiWx917"**, **"Open Example Project in Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with SiWx91x and Simplicity Studio

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device, refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with SiWx91x and Simplicity Studio

- The current implementation will support CMAC single-part mac computation and verification.

### Application Configuration Parameters

The following MAC algorithms are supported in this example:

* `PSA_ALG_CMAC` (single-part)

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.
- The `psa_mac_compute()` and `psa_mac_verify()` functions should give the expected results.

### Expected output
